        <p> "Do you hear that?" I say to Bernard.</p>
        <p>He stops and looks at me with blueberries and broccoli dangling out of his mouth. We listen to the waiters and manager talk to each other. Bernard drops whatever remaining food in his mouth and onto the plate. He slurps his lips. We hear two police officers talking on their walkie-talkies as the manager motions them and signals at us.</p>
        <p>"They're onto to us," Bernard replies. "What's the plan?" </p>
        <p>"I'm unsure. They're closing in. Once we get out the door, we're free. But..." I pause.
        <p>"We both might not get out," Bernard adds. </p> 
        <p>"Yeah," I say. "Cops are at the exits; waiters and manager are coming towards us. If we divide, they'll easily overpower us. If we move away, they'll corner us. We need to simulatenously surprise and confront them so we catch them off guard." </p>
        <p>"Together." </p>
        <p>"Yeah, together. <em>Cops and robbers </em> time."</p>
        <p>"Only if I get to play robber," Bernard says. </p>
        <p>"Sure. They'll <em>never</em> expect that. And if you get out, you need to run to where Barry dropped us off. He'll be there in about five minutes after he finishes grocery shopping."</p>
        <p>"How will you get back?" Bernard asks.</p>
        <p>"I got my own lift. I'll take the scenic route. Wait until they get closer to us. Like now. And in three seconds, three, two--"</p>

        <br><p>The sun rises as I limp in Millenium Park. I smell grass and hear crickets. The grass feels moist below my paws. I'm missing part of my ear, and I had received heavy scratches from earlier when I chased Bernard around the Animal Cafe and into the waiters, police, and everyone else caught between us. It scared everyone in the cafe; all the animals had panicked and went after everyone and thing, and another dog must've bitten me at some point. Fortunately, I got rid of the collar and bell when one of the other animals--I think a rotweiler--tried to bite my neck. It  got the collar and the rest of my blue shark costume instead, but not without me receiving major cuts while allowing me to slip out unnoticed so I could hide. </p>
        <p>I approach the Art Institute of Chicago and pass the Jay Pritzker Pavilion. I walk  near the trash can and bush where I had parked the ship, and I yell, "<em>Fear me </em>, Earthlings!" It's the password for my ship to signal when I'm ready to leave. I wait a few minutes. I <em>worry</em>. Perhaps it lost power and cloaking device stopped working? I wait another few minutes. Suddenly, I hear footsteps approaching near me. I turn and spy a police officer, coming near me. He whispers on his radio that he found the reported animal. He believes it's a fox that was attacking local animals, and he starts to draw his gun. I begin to run, thinking that my time in this universe is about to end. I envision all my friends in both planets around me, every memory and conversation. Just as I'm about to accept my end, I feel my hair stand up, look up and see a bright light above me. </p>
        
        <p>I'm inside my ship. Communications are up. The police officer had fainted when the flying saucer--no bigger than desk--approached and snatched me up into the heavens. I look at thousands of unread messages. I see reports that they've concluded that I died on my mission to Earth. I have two lives that I can return and start over. I think of my friends on both planets. Sure, it's survival of the fittest at my home world, and my colleagues may eat me if I run out of use for them, but they still await for my return so they can decide whether Earthlings poses a credible threat to us so we can crush and plunder them before they get too advanced. Sure, my captors, despite their weird habbits are oddly endearing just their prisonors whom they keep as pets. I'll miss my committee meetings with Bernard, Speedy, and menagerie of other animals that Melody takes home from work. I fly above Chicago, seeing the whole skyline near Lake Michigan and the sun above the clouds in the backdrop of light blue. I look at two buttons: a big green button to autopilot back to my planet near Tabby's Star, and a big red button that will enable me to safely eject on the ground.</p><br>
