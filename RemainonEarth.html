        <p>I hover near Wrigley Field and hit the eject button. The ship teleports me in stadium. Just when I thought that I was safe on the grass, I  see baseballs land nearby until I witness a flash of light. I feel as though my head will explode. I blink. When I open my eyes again, I find myself in my captors' bedroom. I can move, but I can barely see from my left or right. Worse than a collar and bell is both this damn funnel around my neck and also these wretched bandages all over my head and body. Speedy, Bernard, Rahul, and Melody are on the bed with me. Rahul pokes me, saying "Hey buddy-buddy," and Melody slaps his fingers off me. Bernard barks, "Doggy-licks for all!" He tries to lick me in the face as Rahul holds him back before we see Speedy approaching me. Rahul lunges to grab Speedy, but only grabs her quills. As he screams, Melody calls him an idiot, and I look at the hung wall decor that reads, "Home sweet home."</p> <br>
